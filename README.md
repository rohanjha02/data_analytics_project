# Description
The following file is a Data Analytics Project based on the co2 
Emissions in India. Using a dataset from the Our World in Data website. 
We cleaned, manipulated and transformed the data in order to perform the 
analysis for the project. The Data Analytics project includes a prediction model that 
predicts the co2 emissions with respect to the year input by user. It also provides a 
Exploratory Descriptive Analysis and Visualisations for the same. 
# Dataset description
This dataset provides information about various environmental and economic indicators for India over several decades, from 1951 to 2021. The key variables in the dataset include population, gross domestic product (GDP), carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, CO2 emissions from cement production, coal-related CO2 emissions, cumulative CO2 emissions, flaring CO2 emissions, gas-related CO2 emissions, oil-related CO2 emissions, and temperature changes associated with methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O).
